# Airbnb Clone Backend: Features and Functionalities

## 1. Objective

This document outlines the key features and functionalities that the backend system for the Airbnb Clone project must support. The information presented here is derived from the "Project Requirements for the Airbnb Clone Backend" document.

The primary visual representation of these features and functionalities is provided in a dbdiagram.io named `backend_features_functionalities.png` located within this directory. This README serves as a textual accompaniment and summary.
