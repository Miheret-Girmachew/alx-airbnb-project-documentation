# Airbnb Clone Backend: Requirement Specifications

## 1. Introduction

This document provides detailed technical and functional requirement specifications for key backend features of the Airbnb Clone project. These specifications are intended to guide the development, testing, and deployment of the backend system. They build upon the initial project requirements, feature lists, and diagrams previously created.

The requirements are broken down by feature, detailing API endpoints, data input/output, validation rules, and relevant non-functional criteria like security and performance.

## 2. General Requirements

*   **API Standard:** All APIs should adhere to RESTful principles.
*   **Authentication:** All protected endpoints must use JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication.
*   **Authorization:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) will be implemented (Guest, Host, Admin).
*   **Data Format:** JSON will be the standard format for request and response bodies.
*   **Error Handling:** Consistent error response formats should be used, including appropriate HTTP status codes and clear error messages.
*   **Logging:** Comprehensive logging should be implemented for requests, errors, and significant events.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL will be used as the relational database.
*   **Security:** Input validation, output encoding, protection against common vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, CSRF), and secure password storage are mandatory.

## 3. Feature: User Authentication & Management

This feature covers user registration, login, profile management, and related authentication/authorization mechanisms.

### 3.1. User Registration

*   **FR-AUTH-001: New User Account Creation**
    *   **Description:** Allow new users to register for an account.
    *   **Actor:** Unauthenticated User
    *   **Functional Requirements:**
        *   The system shall allow a user to create an account by providing first name, last name, email, password, and role (guest/host).
        *   The system shall validate that the email address is unique.
        *   The system shall securely hash and store the user's password.
        *   Upon successful registration, the system may send a verification email (optional based on final design).
    *   **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/auth/register`
    *   **Input (Request Body - JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "firstName": "string (required, max 255)",
          "lastName": "string (required, max 255)",
          "email": "string (required, valid email format, unique, max 255)",
          "password": "string (required, min 8 chars, complex)",
          "role": "string (required, enum: 'guest' or 'host')"
        }
        ```
    *   **Output (Response Body - JSON - Success 201):**
        ```json

        }
        ```
    *   **Validation Rules:**
        *   `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `password`, `role` are mandatory.
        *   Email must be a valid format and unique in the `User` table.
        *   Password must meet complexity requirements (e.g., min 8 characters, include uppercase, lowercase, number, special character).
        *   `role` must be either 'guest' or 'host'.
    *   **Error Responses:**
        *   `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input, missing fields, password mismatch (if confirmPassword included).
        *   `409 Conflict`: Email already exists.
        *   `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side issues.
    *   **Security:** Passwords must be hashed using a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2). No sensitive data in success response other than ID/email.

This document provides a foundational set of requirements. In a full-scale project, each requirement would be further broken down, and more features (like Reviews, Payments, Admin panel functionalities, Notifications) would be detailed similarly. Test cases would also be derived from these specifications.
