# Airbnb Clone Backend: User Stories

## 1. Objective

This document introduces the collection of user stories derived from the use case diagram and feature list of the Airbnb Clone backend project. User stories are a key component of agile development, capturing system requirements from an end-user perspective. They help to ensure that development efforts are focused on delivering value to the users.

The actual user stories are detailed in the `user-stories.md` file within this directory.

## 2. What is a User Story?

A user story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:

**As a `<type of user>`, I want `<some goal>` so that `<some reason/benefit>`.**

## 3. Purpose of User Stories in this Project

*   **Clarify Requirements:** Translate abstract features into concrete, user-focused requirements.
*   **Guide Development:** Provide a clear understanding of what needs to be built and why.
*   **Facilitate Communication:** Serve as a basis for discussion among stakeholders and the development team.
*   **Prioritization:** Help in prioritizing development tasks based on user value.

## 4. Source of User Stories

The user stories documented in `user-stories.md` are primarily derived from:
*   The "Features and Functionalities" documentation.
*   The "Use Case Diagram" visualizing user-system interactions.

Each story aims to capture a specific piece of functionality that a user (Guest, Host, or Admin) would want to perform with the Airbnb Clone system. While the `user-stories.md` file contains a selection of key stories as per the task requirements, a full project would typically have a more extensive list covering all granular functionalities.
